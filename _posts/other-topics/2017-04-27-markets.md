problem-opportunities:
  - "<b>Priority problems</b> in markets include lack of transportation and infrastructure (roads), barriers in the value chain (such as lack of value-added facilities), packing products are expensive and inaccessible in rural areas, no market standards, poor postharvest practices and infrastructure, poor export opportunities, export standards are not generally known, undervaluing of local varieties for international marketing (ie landrace pear varieties)."
  - "<b>Priority opportunities</b> include improved postharvest practices, infrastructure for post harvest (cool storage, packing houses, drying houses, etc.), promoting sorting and grading so that higher quality products can be sold for more, raising awareness of postharvest practices, simple devices for measuring postharvest status (thermometers, phsycrometer, etc), establishing international trade agreements. "
  - "Priority problems and opportunities are based on feedback from Sharif Shah Resteen, Megan Mayzelle, and Dylan Keith."
