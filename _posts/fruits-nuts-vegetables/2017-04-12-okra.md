  - "<b>Priority problems</b> for okra include: IPM for fusarium wilt, verticilium wilt, powdery mildew (eastern regions), leaf spots, aphids, leafhopper, and root-knot nematodes."
  - "<b>Priority opportunities</b> include: long crop rotation and proper irrigation and fertilization to reduce build up and susceptibility of disease and soil pathogens; plant disease-resistant varieties, control for other pests (such as white fly), discourage cultivation of okra around cotton fields, intercrop with non-host crops, and collect and burn diseased okra/ bhindi plants to reduce spread of disease; apply soapy sprays, malathion, or Azadiracthin (aphid control) and carbofuran at the time of sowing (leafhopper control)."
  - "These priorities and opportunities are based on feedback from agricultural experts at Nangrhar University and DAIL, and Professor Sidajan of Laghman DAIL Department of Horticulture. "
