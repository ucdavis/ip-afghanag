post-harvest:
  - "Improved cultural practices can help prevent fruit splitting. Pick fruits at optimal timing: when fully ripe they should make a metallic sound when tapped.  The ripe fruit should be carefully selected and picked by hand and not pulled from the tree. Grade according to quality and keep different qualities separate."
