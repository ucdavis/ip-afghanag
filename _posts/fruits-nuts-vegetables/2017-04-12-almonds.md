seasons: "Winter"
time: "mid December through mid March"
tree-management:
  - "Pruning. Prune trees in December/January to allow more light into the tree to promote growth of new fruiting wood."
  - "Remove dead, diseased, drooping branches and “suckers” in the center of trees."
care:
  - "Remove and destroy old nuts on trees and on ground to reduce overwintering navel orangeworms."
  - "Spray trees with dormant oil to kill peach twig borer, San Jose scale, and mite eggs."
problem-opportunities:
  - "<b>Priority problems</b> for Afghanistan almonds include: nursery production of more consistent true-to type trees (i.e., similar trees producing more and better nuts), training & pruning, pollination, and IPM for almonds: European red mite, fruit tree leaf roller, San Jose scale, tree borers, bacterial canker, brown rot blossom blight, shot hole disease."
  - "<b>Priority opportunities</b> include production of more soft shelled varieties like Satar Bai, which routinely sell well at the farm gate. There is also a need for certified varieties from approved nursery sales (such as PHDP)."
  - "These draft problems and opportunities are based on feedback from Tom Brown, agricultural consultants, and Afghan specialists."
