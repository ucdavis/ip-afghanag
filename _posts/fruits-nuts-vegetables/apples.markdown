seasons: "Winter"
time: "mid December through mid March"
care: "Prune out any crossing, broken, or shaded out branches from the interior of the tree. No topping or hedging is necessary and removal of the skirts around the lower portion of the tree's bearing capacity. If scale insects are present (appear as small bumps on twigs and a black sooty mold on the leaves), spray the tree with volk or superior oil. The best time to treat is February during cool weather. Thorough coverage is important."
