  - "<b>Priority problems</b> include rill and gully (water) erosion, wind erosion, poor grazing practices, root excavation, excessive tree and brush removal."
  - "<b>Priority Opportunities</b> include control grazing, terracing, loose stone check dams (See FAO Watershed Management Manual - Gully Control); improved and increased fodder production in irrigated areas; nursery improvement for range rehabilitation."

  - "<b>Streambank erosion due to flooding</b>"

  - "<b>Priority problems</b> include loss of agricultural land base, destruction of infrastructure (bridges, buildings and dams)"
  - "<b>Priority Opportunities</b> include check dams, gabion baskets (picture at right), retaining walls"

  - "<b>Deforestation</b>"

  - "<b>Priority problems</b> include heavy demand for firewood as primary fuel source and grazing pressure from livestock"
  - "<b>Priority Opportunities</b> include alternative fuel sources (particularly gas and mini-hydropower using local waterways), public awareness, protecting young trees from animals to permit natural regrowth, pistachio forests"

  - "These priorities and opportunities are based on feedback from John Groninger (SIU) and Ahmad Zia Mirzada (MAIL)."

overview:
  - "Afghanistan is a mountainous country in a dry part of the world which experiences extremes of climate and weather. Winters are cold and snowy, and summers hot and dry. The wet season generally runs from winter through early spring, but the country on the whole is dry, falling within the Desert or Desert Steppe climate classification. Very little snow falls in the lowland deserts of the southwest, but the snow season averages roughly October-April in the mountains and varies considerably with elevation. (US National Climatic Data Center, NOAA)"
  - "Afghanistan has three main land regions:"
  - "<ul>"
  - "<b>Northern Plains</b>. Temperatures average about 38F (3C) in January and approximately 90F (32C) in July. Average annual precipitation is 7in (180mm)."
  - "<b>Central Highlands</b>. Temperatures average about 25F (-4C) in January and approximately 75F (24C) in July. Average annual precipitation is 15in (380mm)."
  - "<b>Southwestern Lowlands</b>. Desert or semi desert land. Temperatures average about 35F (2C) in January and approximately 85F (29C) in July. Average annual precipitation ranges from 2 to 9in (50 to 230mm)."
