care: "Poultry are a common household animal and an often undervalued source of nutrition and income. Poultry are often raised by women and children."
problem-opportunities:
  - "<b>Priority problems</b> of poultry production in Afghanistan are disease (especially Newcastle Disease), lack of housing (which means birds are lost to predators and bird health is difficult to monitor) and adequate nutrition."
  - "<b>Priority Opportunities</b> are vaccinate chickens against disease (especially Newcastle Disease), provide housing, improve practices for introducing new birds (isolate for two weeks) and improve nutrition. Note: Once Newcastle Disease is better managed, other diseases such as coccidiosis, infectious bursal disease, and ectoparasites (such as mites) will become the next major limitations."
