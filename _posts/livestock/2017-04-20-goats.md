care: "Livestock are an important source of meat and milk, wool, leather and farm power. For many rural families, farm animals are the sole source of family income, nutrition, draft power and organic manures for farming. Livestock products are a main source of income for farmers and are the only income source for nomads."
problem-opportunities:
  - "<b>Priority problems</b> for goat production in Afghanistan are adequate <a href='../files/cattle-nutrition.pdf'>nutrition</a> and  <a href='../files/live-biosecurity.pdf'>disease prevention</a>, low productivity of local breeds, insufficient quality of <a href='../files/pigeon-pea-infosheet.pdf'>fodder/feed</a> particularly during winter, insufficient quality of veterinary services for control of animal disease in remote areas, insufficient collection, storage, and marketing facilities for livestock products, lack of farmers’ knowledge and skills regarding animal husbandry and health, insufficient training and upgrading skills and knowledge of technical staff/trainer in the field of livestock health and production, and a lack of proper training of community members in remote areas. The most critical problem for livestock development is the shortage of trained staff especially at the under-graduate level and undeveloped value chains in the field of livestock. "
  - "<b>Priority Opportunities</b> for goat production include livestock agribusiness and value chains, pasture improvement / use of marginal farm lands for pasture cultivation, rangeland management and improvement, winter feed for livestock, feed ingredient production (e.g. corn, rice, rice-polish , cotton cake, wheat bran and etc), relationship between Veterinary Field Units (VFUs) and livestock farmers, impact of farm store centers and agriculture depots on livestock farmers, improvement in the genetic potential of local animals breeds, livestock insurance, and livestock research."
  - "These priority problems and opportunities are based on feedback from the Department of Livestock at MAIL."
