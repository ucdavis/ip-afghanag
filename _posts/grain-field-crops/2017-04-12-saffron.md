care: "Saffron is a high value crop and consequently attracts a lot of interest. Saffron Production Production has traditionally been primarily in Herat, although in recent years many development organizations have spearheaded efforts to produce it in other regions of the country.  Care must be taken in recommending it due to its very specialized production and postharvest handling practices as well as marketing challenges."
