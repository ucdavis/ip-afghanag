seasons: "Winter"
time: "mid December through mid March"
care: "Chickpea is a major legume crop grown predominantly in northeast and central provinces, including Takhar, Kunduz, Herat, Basakhshan, Mazar-Sarif, Smangan, Bamiyan, Baghlan, Kapista, Wardal, Ghazni and Zabol provinces, usually by rainfed irrigation systems. Two major types of chickpea exist in Afghanistan: kabuli, a lighter-colored large seed, and desi, which is smaller and darker with a rough coat."
problem-opportunities:
  - "<b>Priority problems</b> include aphids, weed control (poor access to herbicides and poor mechanical control practices), fungal diseases including ascochytarabiei, fusarium, and safidak kazip (local name; scientific name unknown), lack of access to resistant varieties or effective fungicides, and poor storage practices (too dry decreases germination rate, too wet rots)."
  - "<b>Priority opportunities</b> include training in best storage practices (moisture 10-13%, clean and pest-proofed), improved seed access to inputs such as effective pesticides and improved varieties, and training in mechanical weed control/prevention practices."
