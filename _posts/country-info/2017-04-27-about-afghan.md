  <h2>National Constraints (from World Bank) </h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Water.</b>Only about 30% of the country’s available water resources are currently in use, and at very low efficiency and productivity. Irrigation and rural water supply infrastructure have deteriorated due to strife, drought, and lack of maintenance. Reduction in ground cover in hillsides has led to floods, widespread soil erosion, and reduced water retention in aquifers.</li>   
    <li><b>Forests.</b>The country’s limited forest resources suffered depletion to meet demands from lucrative export markets and for firewood.</li>   
    <li><b>Livestock.</b> Severe overgrazing and the recent drought have contributed to the decline of the livestock population.</li>   
    <li><b>Markets.</b>Constrains include poorly maintained road network, fears about security, inadequate market facilities (even lacking basic water, electricity, and sewage in many cases), telecommunications and support services like market information systems, food safety regulations, grades and standards, and quality control.</li>
